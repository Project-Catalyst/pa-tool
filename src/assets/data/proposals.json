This approach also removes the East versus the West binary and allows us to recognize that people everywhere are affected by systems that are too complex to challenge.\u00a0\n\n  \n\nIt is also important to begin thinking this way because it lifts everyone up as opposed to creating a siloed improvement.

Second layer solutions are also being used as alternatives to Ethereum main chain, Polygon has been a great example.\n\nIn this migration and bridges creation scenario, some projects are turning to Cardano to create their DeFi projects.\n\nCardano is finally delivering smart contracts and that opens a door to a lot of innovation in DeFi. We can offer not only a scalable blockchain, but also a secure blockchain and aggregated governance layer in the near future. This set of characteristics place Cardano in a prominent place and with a good opportunity to gain market share and expand the user base.\n\nWith Catalyst, we have the opportunity to fund DeFi projects and allow them to have greater decentralization and resilience, which are essential aspects for DeFi projects. Many projects end up accepting the participation of Venture Capitals due to lack of financial resources. The participation of VCs in DeFi projects usually ends up causing a large part of the supply distribution to be alocated to VCs and this compromises the decentralization and consequently the security of these projects.\n\nThe DeFi ecosystem today is taken over by projects full of vulnerabilities, hacks are constant, economic models are copied from other projects, decentralization is no longer a priority and few projects are dedicated to create economic models/bonding curves/algorithms thinking about the users' needs.\n\nIt has become clear over the year that bugs, hacks and vulnerabilities are not unique to smart contracts on Ethereum. Dapps running on Binance Smart Chain and Cosmos suffered from vulnerabilities as well.\n\nhttps://cointelegraph.com/news/hackers-stole-at-least-600m-in-poly-exploit-across-three-chains\n\nhttps://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/111660/thorchain-suffers-5-million-exploit-developers-have-put-out-a-fix\n\nCardano arrives to change this paradigm and bring security to users.\n\nPrivacy and resistance to censorship are also important but often overlooked in favor of subsidizing (yield farming).

Even ensuring a good score is difficult to get engagement in the voting stage to compete with consolidated and influential teams in the Cardano community.\n\nThis challenge intends to sow new teams, who have never received funding from Catalyst so they can have a chance to show their value to the community.\n\n  \n\nEach new team can request up to 25% of the total $200,000 USD budget, also know as $50,000 USD.\n\nE.g.\n\n*   Team A with 2 proposals of $25,000 USD\n*   Team B with 5 proposals of $10,000 USD\n*   Team C with 1 proposal of $50,000 USD\n*   Team D with 1 proposal of $15,000 USD + 1 proposal of $35,000 US\n\n  \n\nThe 200,000 USD budget has been set so that it can accommodate the demand seen in previous Funds for DeFi-related proposals in the \"Scale-UP Cardano's DeFi Ecosystem\" and \"Dapps & Integrations\" challenges. It is also important to take into account that DeFi dApps sometimes require more experienced developers due to the nature of DeFi dapps requiring high levels of guarantee, after all they are mission critical applications and the smart contracts of these dApps will guarantee the safety of users and large amounts Of money.\n\nIt is important to note that 25% is the maximum amount of aggregated budget that the same team can request in this challenge, but any amount below that can be requested. This means that the challenge will have space for at least 4 proposals from different teams, which guarantees greater chances for teams with less popularity and that may be overshadowed by more popular teams in the community.\n\nIn the image below(see atachments) it is possible to see several dapp projects related to DeFi that are being developed on Cardano's blockchain (DEXs, Lending+Borrowing, Stable Coins, Synthetic Assets, Oracles, Derivatives and Insurance)", "how_does_success_look_like_": "At least 4 new teams deploying DeFi dapps on Cardano in 2022 + Managing to form a community in order to gain competitiveness/susteinability", "importance": "So that new teams can have a kickstart in their projects without having to resort to ICOs and VCs\u00a0 allocation."}, {"id": 369714, "category": 26120, "no_assessments": 0, "title": "Climate Change: THE Challenge", "url": "https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369714-48088", "description": "Climate Change is humanities greatest challenge going forward. **How will Cardano contribute to solving this wicked problem?**", "requested_funds": "270000", "challenge_brief": "**Climate Change is humanities greatest challenge going forward.**\n\nWE NEED EVERYONE TO TAKE ACTION.\u00a0\n\nWE ARE WHO WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR.\n\n**Cardano and its community should be at the forefront of providing solutions.**\n\nThe Project Catalyst platform is where the community could generate and support bright ideas to face climate change, make a direct impact and start a ripple effect.

This makes Japan a likely country to adopt solutions built on top of Cardano. There are already some active community members and SPO's but participation in Catalyst is still relatively low.\u00a0\n\nRecently an Eastern Town Hall was started by community members and participation in the Japanese breakout room has been among the highest consistently. In the fund 6 challenges there are several proposals coming from the Japanese community as well. With the current momentum a challenge in fund 7 would likely see good participation and can solidify the community.\n\n  \n\nAt the moment most of Ideascale & Catalyst operates in english. This creates a barrier for all non-english communities. If solutions from this challenge prove successful in bridging that gap, they can function as an example for other communities.\n\n\\--\n\nChallenge Brief\n\nThe goal of this challenge is to find ways to further engage the Japanese community and to help create ways for the Japanese and English speaking community to connect. Proposers are encouraged to propose in Japanese and the Challenge team will help promote the CA role in the Eastern Town hall or equivalent event.\n\nThe budget is set to 50k because the Challenge focuses only on a specific part of the community. There are also projects from Japan which have a broad application and will fit in other challenges. Considering the focus is on community building the budget should be enough to support 2-6 meaningful efforts.\n\n  \n\nPossible directions:\n\n\\-Translating key documentation\n\n\\-Creating educational content about Cardano & Catalyst in Japanese\n\n\\-Organising interpreters for Catalyst events\n\n\\-Organising workshops for new members, CA's, SPO's, proposers\n\n\\-Setting up community hubs\n\n  \n\nChallenge Team\n\nThe Challenge team consists of two active members from the Japanese community and one member from the general community. Among them there is experience with proposing & facilitating. The challenge team members have previously helped with the organising both Eastern Town Hall (Japan Breakout) and After Town Hall sessions\n\n

The challenge for fund 7 should be to take Catalyst to the streets by financing, at a 75% level (open to changes), various community proposed projects with a common goal. The original idea was that these outlets/businesses would have one thing in common: any sales made in ADA would come at a 10/15/20% discount. For example, a coffee or restaurant which sells a coffee at 1$ would sell it at 0.85$ (15% discount) if paid in ADA.\u00a0 However, proposers could come up with other creative ways to incentivise and facilitate adoption of ADA through their projects.\n\nThe idea of this new challenge is to fund at a 75% aid intensity proposed projects which incentivise adoption of Cardano. This challenge would involve inactive people already present within Catalyst since it opens up Catalyst for anybody who wants to start his/her own business. The reason for not fully funding the project is that one would want some accountability by the proposer.\u00a0\n\n  \n\n**Refund Process**\n\n2/5% of all sales generated (depending on the operating margin of the business) is to be sent back to the treasury (or a separate treasury specifically for the challenge). On a base case, I would expect that investment is fully returned after 5 years time. However, evaluation of projects is crucial and must be strictly conducted.\u00a0\n\n  \n\n**Spreading adoption / Avoiding Concentration of projects**\n\nI would suggest that such fund be divided in countries where only 1 project per country can be awarded per fund. There can be a bonus project with double the fund allocation to allow for market penetration in acclaimed areas where rent costs (amongst others) would be much higher. This project is giving incentives to people to join the Cardano ecosystem by providing them with financial motivation to have their project funded. Secondly, once a funded project is up and running, customers of this project's business would have a reason why they should hold at least in a small portion, some ADA currency. The reason being to have a discount for their purchases.\n\nThe business must clearly advertise the 'discount' and in case where there are sales persons or cashier's they must clearly tell each customer that there is a discount for those paying with ADA.\n\nAlso, there must be a sign where it says \"Funded by Project Catalyst (Cardano)\".\u00a0\n\n  \n\n**E-commerce portals**\n\nThis is also very easily done on websites with an online payment option, where a discount is shown to apply if you chose the 'pay with ADA' option.\u00a0\n\n  \n\n**++Evaluating a proposal++**\n\nA business plan with clear revenue and profit forecasts must be put forward. Rationale of how one arrived to the figures must be clear and expenses must be substantiated by evidence where possible. Community advisors should have a background in finance or be successful entrepreneurs themselves. Ideally a scoring sheet is agreed one, a project would at least need 50% to be considered and then stars allocated accordingly to scoring.\n\n***Diversification from competitors:***\n\nThe idea is to incentivise people to set-up a wallet and purchase ADA. Projects which are diverse from the competition should be preferred. So we are talking about product differentiation, price competition, innovative products.\u00a0\n\n***Location:***\n\nObviously, highly frequented locations would be preferred since they would have the greatest potential since they would reach much more people.\n\n***Grant requested:***\n\nThe higher the grant requested the lower the score. This would automatically balance other evaluation criteria (eg. location) and the right balance between exposure (for proposals in densely populated areas and popular neighborhoods) and cost of investment (proposals in popular neighborhoods would naturally require a higher investment).\n\n***Time of completion:***\n\nThe lower the time of completion of the proposal, the higher the score. We want proposals to be set-up in a short time to start making an effect as fast as possible. A maximum limit of time (eg. 1.5 years) should be also put in place.\n\n***Readiness of proposer:***\n\nThe readier and the more prepared a prospective entrepreneur is, the better. Does the propose already have a lease contract in hand? Has the proposer contacted and acquired quotations for work needed? Has contact with suppliers been established? Has and marketing study been undertaken to identify the need for the business (especially in case of innovative ideas or niche markets) ?\n\n***Capability and experience of entrepreneur:***\n\nIs the entrepreneur knowledgeable in the proposed business venture? Has the proposer owned or does he/she still own similar businesses or any business at all?\u00a0\n\n***Branding and Copyright:***\n\nThis has not been tackled yet and ideally a brand would be set up by IOHK with free licensing to the selected projects or even external investors upon review of their project. This licence could also be used to set an agreement for the 2/5% revenue \u00b4fee\u00b4 (which then the treasury should hold the licensing rights). It would be very powerful for Cardano to build an empire of \"Caf\u00e8 ADA\" around the globe. How could it be ignored? Or even have the 'ADA journal' or 'Cardano Times' with its newsroom. As long as the projects are profitable, the treasury will grow exponentially and in 10 years any project would be practically possible.\u00a0\n\n  \n\n**++Auditability++**\n\nHow do you know that the proposer is respecting the terms of the grant?\n\nFirst of all, when issuing the grant, it has to be done upon presentation of invoices, proof of payment and evidence of work done. Community advisors can do this, or a separate committee appointed.\n\nSecondly, the way payments in ADA are to be effected would be though a QR code displayed on the cashier counter. The code would hold the business wallet address. This should be a function which will become present in wallets.\n\nNow, how does one ensure that these guidelines are being followed ? One should first rely on the community to flag irregularities.\u00a0 As the community is quite large and continues to grow, it should be enough to regulate or check these businesses (simply by visiting these places). Secondly, especially at the start of the challenge, a set of mystery shoppers can be tasked to visit certain place at a certain frequency to ensure that the project is reaching its goals. One would simply have people shop at these businesses and report back. Mystery shopper should be paid say 50$ in ADA for each visit.\u00a0\n\n  \n\n**How does the business make a profit if it has lower margins than the discount offered?**\n\nThe discount given to ADA payers would be essentially written off against the rest of the sales. Furthermore, most businesses like supermarkets, coffee shops and bars have higher profit margins than 20%. Besides the margin, one has to consider the fixed costs including rent, wages, water and electricity and more. However, once the business scales there will be enough sales to cater for these expenses. Problems could arise if the ADA sales represent a sizable portion of total sales. This is highly unlikely especially at the early stages, nonetheless, in this case the discounts can be scaled down proportionally with the increase in ADA paid sales.\n\n  \n\n**Reporting back to Catalyst:**\n\nIt is important that the proposal winners submit monthly reports on the Sales made in ADA as compared to other sales (cash or card). Reporting should include, Sales value in ADA vs Total Sales Value, Number of sales in ADA vs Total number of sales, Sales made to Community Wallets (from anonymous wallet register to rewards voters, CAs and VCAs), Payments received from New Wallets (not as accurate since people can have different wallet addresses but still useful) and Repetitive sales to known wallets. Reports shall be strictly confidential and to issue data in percentage terms or absolute numbers.\n\n  \n\n**++Problems solved++**\n\n***1)Community engagement:***\n\nThis has often been limited to developers as many people lack knowledge and skills to even put forward a proposal. This challenge opens the gates to literally anybody who is willing to open a business.\n\n***2)Cardano Exposure:***\n\nMany proposals talk about marketing and advertisements. Well, what better advertisement that to have a coffe shop named \"Caf\u00e8 ADA\" or \"Cafe Cardano\" in the middle of a busy street which offer large discount for crypto payments. And through the community already existing in Cardano, we can have at least 10 places in various countries open at each Fund round, increasing at an exponential rate through revenue generation of the fund itself.\n\n***3)Incentivise and Retain Community advisors and voters:***\n\nOutlets themselves can offer increased discounts to Community Advisors and Voters (a wallet register would be set-up - identity can still be kept anonymous) thereby incentivising participation of both advisors and voters. This can be linked with an eventual honour/tier system which has been proposed for the advisors and voters based on their output.\n\n***4)Attracting new Entrepreneurs to the Ecosystem:***\n\nThese sort of grants would definitely attract the ear of various entrepreneurs who either do not have the funding or else do not want to take on the risk of opening their business. Naturally, the set-off would be that any project must incentivise the use or adoption of Cardano.\n\n**5)Expand the network through actual use cases and incentives**\n\nIncetivise the general public to become part of Cardano by offering them a reason to do it - purchase at a discounted rate. Aligning interests of the public of cost savings with those of Cardano.\n\n***6) Sustainability; A Self-financing Challenge:***\n\nIf all goes well, this challenge will be self sustaining and could also feed the treasury as a profit will eventually be made by the business and the treasury (be it the existing one or a separate one) will continue to benefit.\n\n  \n\n**++Attachment: Actual figures from existing coffee shop++**\n\nPlease find attached the figure of an actual coffee shop who is not very popular, an average coffee shop (max capacity 40 persons), operates at some 50% capacity during weekdays and maybe 75% on weekends. The figures have been exchanged from Euro to Dollars. A projection for proposals has been extracted which assumes that there are 10% of total sales made in ADA and that such sales have a 15% discount. Furthermore, a 5% refund to Catalyst has been added. This shows that it is quite doable and that projects are basically refunded after 4-5 years assuming a 100k investment. I myself am a financial advisor (warranted accountant and auditor) dealing with start-ups and creating realistic business plans (often to determine amount of funding required from banks). As part of my job, I also help businesses apply for a number of EU grants and local government funding which adhere to very strict regulations and checks.\n\n  \n\n**++Existing businesses++**\n\nA fund can be set-up to incentivise existing businesses to introduce crypto payments and offer discounts for ADA payments. This would also apply for those already offering ADA payment options, these would then have to introduce applicable discounts. This can be seen as a marketing fund\u00a0where monthly payments (say $500/m) can be sent out to each business which is chosen. Ideally, for auditability purposes, e-commerce business should be given priority since these can easily be verified just by accessing their website.\n\n**++Funding++**\n\nAssuming a 100,000 grant which would mean an investment of 100,000/0.75=133,333 , a 1,000,000 allocation could finance 10 businesses every funding round or 9 businesses if the double financing project is added. This is a good starting point.\n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n**Thank you for taking the time to read.

More people have access to better healthcare, decent work, and education than ever before. But inequalities and climate change are threatening to undo the gains.\n\nWith the world increasingly facing the extremely damaging impacts of climate change upon ecosystems, populations and species, the need to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C cannot be contested. Alarming data includes the loss of primary rainforest equivalent to a football pitch every 6 seconds in 2019 leading to dramatic consequences such as soil erosion, flooding, loss of biodiversity, carbon release or fishery livelihoods being threatened in small island developing countries, or the Coral Triangle region in South-East Asia due to warming water temperatures and coral bleaching.\n\n**At the core of the 2020-2030 decade of action is the need for action** to tackle growing poverty, empower women and girls, and address the climate emergency. Sustainable development has been defined as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\n\nSustainable development calls for concerted efforts towards building an inclusive, sustainable and resilient future for people and planet.\n\nFor sustainable development to be achieved, it is crucial to **harmonize** three core elements: economic growth, social inclusion and environmental protection. These elements are **interconnected**, and all are crucial for the well-being of individuals and societies.\n\nAction against climate change entails structural behavioural change at an individual and systemic level to embed sustainable practices.\n\nThis will entail the transition and adoption of frameworks of thinking that ensure sustainability is embedded at all levels of action. From our planetary boundaries to our core social foundations, including all strata of society.\n\n\u2022 Eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions is an indispensable requirement for sustainable development. To this end, there must be promotion of sustainable, inclusive and equitable economic growth, creating greater opportunities for all, reducing inequalities, raising basic standards of living, fostering equitable social development and inclusion, and promoting integrated and sustainable management of natural resources and ecosystems.\n\n\u2022 Investment in inclusive and sustainable economies can unleash significant opportunities for shared prosperity. And the political, technological and financial solutions are within reach. But much greater leadership and rapid, unprecedented changes are needed to align these levers of change with sustainable development objectives. #ForPeopleForPlanet\n\n\u2022 To achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals, annual investment requirements across all sectors have been estimated at around $5-7 trillion. Current investment levels are far from the scale needed. With global financial assets estimated at over $200 trillion, financing is available, but most of these resources are not being channelled towards sustainable development at the scale and speed necessary to achieve the SDGs and objectives of the Paris Agreement on climate change.\n\n\u2022 Interest and investment in the Sustainable Development Goals are growing and investment in the Goals makes economic sense. Achieving the SDGs could open up US$12 trillion of market opportunities and create 380 million new jobs by 2030.\n\n**Cardano Sustainability**\n\n**Encouraging the growth of a Community Led Local Hubs Network as a means of accelerating and expanding the Cardano ecosystem in strategic places for high SDG impact:**\n\nOut of the world's approximately 7.8 billion inhabitants, 6.45 billion do not speak English as their first language. Living in the Western world, one may forget this fact, with many never having considered it.\n\nLet's consider it now.\n\nLet's build an ecosystem that grows sustainably, in harmony from the local to global scale, while remaining inclusive and equitable.\n\nWhen you drive grassroots adoption, you do more than just 'build cool products'; you empower people to change their lives and world in previously unimaginable ways. You give them the tools to imagine that anything is possible.\n\nRemember that the **Bitcoin network is one protocol of the 75% of blockchains that use Proof of Work (PoW) mining power** to reach consensus.\n\nWith consensus on the **Cardano blockchain through Ouroboros estimated to be over four-million times more energy-efficient than the Bitcoin protocol** - let's use the tools available to us today to help build a sustainable world.\n\nIn a world where Cardano exists, maybe we don't have to wish for these things to happen, we make them happen!\n\n**EACH PROPOSAL PUT FORWARD FOR THIS CHALLENGE CAN REQUEST FUNDS AMOUNTING TO NO MORE THAN A MAXIMUM OF 20% OF THE TOTAL FUND AVAILABLE.**\n\n**THIS IS TO PROMOTE AND ENCOURAGE A DIVERSITY OF PROPOSALS :)**\n\n**++Guiding Budget Rationale:++**\n\n*   Basic infrastructure costs\n*   Developer Training, Education and Tools\n*   Catalyst Proposer Onboarding\n*   Translation and Outreach\n*   And more\u2026\n\n  \n\n**++For more information:++**\n\n\\* https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/development-agenda/\n\n\\* https://en.unesco.org/news/unesco-launch-esd-2030-roadmap-africa-region\n\n\\* https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000374802\n\n\\* https://forum.cardano.org/t/world-computers-that-don-t-cost-the-earth/41259\n\n\\* https://forum.cardano.org/t/consensus-on-cardano-vs-other-blockchains/38738\n\n  \n\n**++Videos on sustainability:++**\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkg2XMTWV4g\n\n\\- 1.

Second layer solutions are also being used as alternatives to Ethereum main chain, Polygon has been a great example.\n\nIn this migration and bridges creation scenario, some projects are turning to Cardano to create their DeFi projects.\n\nCardano is finally delivering smart contracts and that opens a door to a lot of innovation in DeFi. We can offer not only a scalable blockchain, but also a secure blockchain and aggregated governance layer in the near future. This set of characteristics place Cardano in a prominent place and with a good opportunity to gain market share and expand the user base.\n\nWith Catalyst, we have the opportunity to fund DeFi projects and allow them to have greater decentralization and resilience, which are essential aspects for DeFi projects.\u00a0Many projects end up accepting the participation of Venture Capitals due to lack of financial resources. The participation of VCs in DeFi projects usually ends up causing a large part of the supply distribution to be alocated to VCs and this compromises the decentralization and consequently the security of these projects.\n\n  \n\nThe DeFi ecosystem today is taken over by projects full of vulnerabilities, hacks are constant, economic models are copied from other projects, decentralization is no longer a priority and few projects are dedicated to create economic models/bonding curves/algorithms thinking about the users' needs.\n\nIt has become clear over the year that bugs, hacks and vulnerabilities are not unique to smart contracts on Ethereum. Dapps running on Binance Smart Chain and Cosmos suffered from vulnerabilities as well.\n\nhttps://cointelegraph.com/news/hackers-stole-at-least-600m-in-poly-exploit-across-three-chains\n\nhttps://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/111660/thorchain-suffers-5-million-exploit-developers-have-put-out-a-fix\n\n  \n\nCardano arrives to change this paradigm and bring security to users.\n\n  \n\nPrivacy and resistance to censorship are also important but often overlooked in favor of subsidizing (yield farming). How to encourage DeFi projects to seek resilience, safety, research-based economic models and critical thinking?\n\n  \n\n**POTENTIAL DIRECTIONS**\n\n*   DEXs\n*   Oracles\n*   Algorithmic stable coins\n*   Borrowing/Lending dapps\n*   Derivatives\n*   Research for open source new financial models (bonding curves)\n\n  \n\n**RATIONAL FOR BUDGET DISTRIBUTION**\n\nTo encourage greater diversity of funded teams and proposals each team can request up to 20% of the total $500,000 USD budget or $100,000 USD.\n\nE.g.\n\n*   Team A with 2 proposals of $50,000 USD\n*   Team B with 1 proposal of $100,000 USD\n*   Team C with 1 proposal of $80,000 USD + 1 proposal of $20,000 US\n\n\u00a0t is important to note that 20% is the maximum amount of aggregated budget that the same team can request in this challenge, but any amount below that can be requested. This means that the challenge will have space for at least 5 proposals from different teams, which guarantees greater chances for teams with less popularity and that may be overshadowed by more popular teams in the community.\n\n  \n\n**RATIONAL FOR BUDGET EXPANSION**\n\nThe 500,000 USD budget has been set so that it can accommodate the demand seen in previous Funds for DeFi-related proposals in the \"Scale-UP Cardano's DeFi Ecosystem\" and \"Dapps & Integrations\" challenges.\u00a0\n\nDeFi projects tend to involve higher costs than conventional dapps due to the nature of DeFi dapps requiring high levels of assurances, after all they are mission critical applications and the smart contracts of these dApps will guarantee the safety of users and large amounts of money.\n\nThese development costs puts pressure on teams to break the budget needed into different proposals across multiple Funds. On one hand, budget fragmentation allows the community to assess performance before committing to allocate a large amount of funds, but on the other hand the need to create proposals in consecutive Funds creates friction for the proposers and increases the workload of CAs across multiple Funds. Another negative aspect is that budget fragmentation ends up damming (like water in a dam) the need for funding and causing proposals to actually end up being funded for development that has already been completed, which is a barrier to innovation.\n\nLooking at the data associated with proposals related to DeFi in Fund5, I noticed that some proposals were submitted in the \"Dapps & Integrations\" challenge. There are some reasons that may justify these proposers choices, such as lack of knowledge about the specific challenge for DeFi (Scale UP Cardano's DeFi Ecosystem) or the preference for competing in another challenge that could be less competitive, which would also be a problem since the challenge of \"Dapps & Integrations\" has been extremely competitive in the last Funds. Below is an image (Image 2) to illustrate the number of approved proposals and proposals that did not receive funding on the Dapps & Integrations Challenge.\n\nThe creation of this challenge(Boosting Cardano's DeFi) can also relieve the pressure for competition in the Dapps & Integrations challenge and make room for dapps that have other use cases besides DeFi.\n\nTo bring more data to my arguments, I created a chart (Image 3) aggregating the DeFi proposals that were in the \"Scale UP Cardano's DeFi Ecosystem\" and \"Dapps & Integrations\" challenges. The intention is to demonstrate the demand for dapps directly related to DeFi.\n\nWhen looking at the DeFi-related proposals that have been approved but not funded, we can see that there are 5 (1 funded by left-over funds , 3 in the Dapps & Integration challenge, and the last in the \"Scale Up Cardano's DeFi Ecosystem\" challenge). These 5 proposals added together requested around $260,000USD.\n\nIn the image 4 it is possible to see several dapp projects related to DeFi that are being developed on Cardano (DEXs, Lending+Borrowing, Stable Coins, Synthetic Assets, Oracles, Derivatives and Insurance)", "how_does_success_look_like_": "A competitive environment for DeFi on Cardano with an emphasis on cross-collaboration & driving composability across protocols.", "importance": "It's important because Defi dApps provide trustless on-demand access to financial services for global users"}, {"id": 368940, "category": 26120, "no_assessments": 0, "title": "Raising small ghosts, SPOs and devs", "url": "https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/368940-48088", "description": "How to raise small SPOs and developers in the Cardano community?", "requested_funds": "100000", "challenge_brief": "Cardano received the \"ghostchain\" nickname by many skeptics, despite the number of SPOs, developers in the Plutus Pioneer Program, community engagement in social media, and several other metrics saying otherwise.\n\n  \n\nMany in our community embraced the term \"ghost\" in a positive way. Some of these \"ghosts\" are extremely dedicated and talented people, but they need and deserve greater reach and support in the community.\n\nSince Shelley's launch, one of the issues that has created long and fruitless debates has been about the sustainability and the difficulty of small SPOs raise delegation versus large pool groups (like Binance), SPOs with multi-pools (like 1PCT) and SPOs influencers (I won't quote them, but you know who they are).\u00a0I want to make it clear that this is all in the rules of the game, but it doesn't mean that it is good for decentralization.\n\nWe know that the K parameter and pledge are important for defining the theoretical number of SPOs, but marketing capacity and social outreach distort the playing field, harming and overshadowing small SPOs.\u00a0\n\nHow can we level the playing field with sustainable, rational and aove all, free market incentives?\n\n  \n\nFurthermore, Catalyst has been an amazing funding option for developers in the Cardano community, but the 3-month cycle of each Fund can dampen innovation. Some projects need quick funding sources. Some projects could be funded by the community itself. Not every good proposal fits a challenge. There is demand for alternative funding models, so why not create space for them outside Catalyst?\n\n  \n\n++Each team can request up to 25% of the total $100,000 USD budget++\n\nE.g.\n\n*   Team A with 2 proposals of $12,500 USD\n*   Team B with 5 proposals of $5,000 USD\n*   Team C with 1 proposal of $25,000 USD\n*   Team D with 1 proposal of $15,000 USD + 1 proposal of $10,000 USD\n\nDue to the experimental and new nature of the challenge I think it is appropriate to set a relatively low budget ($100,000 USD) but a sufficient amount to address a problem that has been regularly debated in the community and which to date there is no clear solution. The idea of limiting a team to requesting up to 25% of the budget is to allow for a greater diversity of ideas and approaches to solving the problem.\n\n  \n\nIt is important to note that 25% is the maximum, any amount below that can be requested. This means that the challenge will have space for at least 4 proposals from different teams, which guarantees greater chances for teams with less popularity and that may be overshadowed by more popular teams in the community.\n\n  \n\n**Potential Directions**\n\n*   Marketing teams to promote small SPOs\n*   Alternative Reward Models (FISO, NFT aidrops)\n*   Crowdfunding and crowdsourcing platforms\n*   Creating advanced filters for selecting small SPOs\n*   Multi delegation research\n*   Explorers and adaptation of wallets to build multi delegation portfolios\n\nIn this video Sebastien Guillemot( Former co-VP of Engineering at Emurgo and dcSpark CTO and co founder) explains the importance of pools distribution(consensus distribution) to increase reliability and assurances for users and dapps on the blockchain:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwlN3DZvmgQ", "how_does_success_look_like_": "Small SPOs and developers have more options, services and tools to get delegates and funding + Greater distribution in block minting.", "importance": "To achieve greater decentralization and resilience in the blockchain through sustainability/feasibility for small SPOs and devs."}, {"id": 368902, "category": 26120, "no_assessments": 0, "title": "Grow Social & Environmental Finance", "url": "https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/368902-48088", "description": "What solutions can we build on Cardano to finance social and environmental innovation?", "requested_funds": "250000", "challenge_brief": "This challenge is about the small ways we can spark a fire under impact investing using the Cardano ecosystem.\n\nImpact investments are made with the intention to generate positive, measurable social and environmental impact alongside financial returns. While a variety of projects push for the adoption of DeFi on Cardano, can we bring to market the potential of DeFi mechanisms as a vehicle for social good?\n\nDelivering an outcome that has an impact is a lot harder than just delivering a financial Return-on-Investment, even a small one. Impact investing (according to the World Economic Forum) is hindered by:\n\n*   The lack and/or high cost of trustworthy data on the social or environmental results of investment, making credible accounting of impacts difficult.\n*   Challenges around the \"attribution\" of impact \u2013 meaning the allocation of an impact-related claim to an investor risks \"double-counting.\"\n*   Roadblocks in monetizing impacts \u2013 illiquid impact markets, uncertain returns, high transaction costs.\n\nPropose market solutions, financial mechanisms, or means of measuring impact.

Through increasing diversity and inclusion, this challenge will act as an accelerator for uncovering and fostering creativity, and encouraging serendipitous discovery and collaboration by helping people and projects in the ecosystem connect and collaborate.\n\nInvesting sufficiently now, to increase diversity in our community will pay off more and more over time as the community grows. This challenge is seeking $150,000 to ensure that we put enough attention on encouraging projects that increase diversity and inclusion and grow our community to many different parts of the planet and including more and more voices from under-represented communities and demographics.

The question is how can they be adopted into the system? If there is only one system governing all funds, changing it comes with a lot of risk. If instead some Challenges use their own system, they can serve as isolated experiments.\n\n  \n\nProposals in the Challenge Setting category could introduce changes within their scope by including them in the challenge description. Some changes might be easier to implement than others and some might require entire side chain solutions. Currently the responsibility to deliver these solutions lies with the Catalyst team.

The group was contracted to design, build, and maintain Cardano through to 2020.\n\nIOG CEO Charles Hoskinson\u00a0recently outlined a major, ambitious vision for shaping up a long-term roadmap pushing Cardano towards 2025.\n\nSome elements of the vision include first completing Ouroboros Omega (which will be available by end of 2021), as a capstone of research. Elements that will be explored are fast finality, sidechains, no reliance on external clocks, the ability to gracefully recover from 51% attacks, plus a little faster TPS.\n\nThe 2025 agenda will includes reaching Ouroboros Omega++.\n\nAnother part of the roadmap is Light Clients (such as Yoroi) which are easy to do with trust assumptions (someone running a server that is a window into the system). There are other protocols on the market such as MINA that uses recursive SNARKs that proof that the coins exist and have not been spent - even without having a copy of the blockchain.\n\nIOG's paper on the Mithral Protocol is expected to come out by end of 2021 and possibly a prototype, with the idea of creating a similar trust model that would allow a light client by default.\u00a0\n\nFor a sidechains model and layer 2 infrastructure, IOG is exploring adding sidechains support for EVM, IELE, Catalyst, etc. via a community approved hard-fork combinator event following a Cardano Improvement Proposal.\u00a0\n\nPrism and DID embedding is also in the pipeline for authenticated wallets and regulated DeFi spaces, permissioned for access with certain credentials and leading to Human Readable Addresses.\u00a0\n\nAnother piece of off-chain infrastructure is Hydra, based on a four paper agenda (two finished, two to be finished by end of 2021). Hydra is a craft-on layer two solution that SPOs will be able to add on. With you have a Cardano DApp you will be able to use Prism for free, as well as using Hydra.\u00a0\n\nOther elements mentioned in scope for 2025 include: quantum resistance, zero-knowledge crypto, quantum resistance with the signature scheme, how to use quantum computers to enhance Cardano, modelling quantum adversaries - a big Quantum agenda.\u00a0\n\nOn the governance side, a lot of work will be done to link Catalyst (concerned with Treasury) with Voltaire (concerned with Protocol updates). The unification will start in 2021, extending and finishing in 2022. The governance system will probably be a bicameral voting model with feedback, expert ballots, correct economics.\n\nIn a April 5 2021 video, Hoskinson stated that IOG's aim is to overbuild the governance stuff in Catalyst and Voltaire by adding other voting systems, such as preference voting, quadratic voting, all of which will be available for use in DApps.\u00a0\n\nIOG will also launch a research agenda to move from a plutocratic model (right now) to a hybrid model (ADA + Proof of Merit). This segment is closer to the 2025 part of the 2021-25 research agenda. The idea is to use different resources inside the system, as people build identity and reputation inside the system.\u00a0\n\n  \n\nCHALLENGE BRIEF:\n\nAs Cardano is a decentralized project and community, the IOG-proposed roadmap is clearly a major contribution for the ecosystem - but it does not eliminate the possibility of alternative and complementary visions. The roadmap that is expected later this year - will also serve as a foundational platform for many more complementary projects, visions, teams and strategies that can start building upon its vision.\u00a0\n\nThe brief for this Challenge is to propose new mechanisms, platforms, teams and tools for development (or the expansion of existing\u00a0mechanisms, platforms, teams and tools) to start working on creating community-based ideas for the Cardano 2025 roadmap.\u00a0\n\nThe future development of Cardano is being planned and decided soon and the community needs to step up and participate.\u00a0\n\n  \n\n\u00a0Important note: This is a Fund6 Challenge Setting proposal - for a future challenge in Fund 7. This means I am not personally applying for funding in this challenge!\n\nThe proposed budget of this proposal will serve to fund multiple proposals developed by future proposers in Fund 7 who would apply to find solutions to this challenge.\n\nI have no proposed solutions nor am I suggesting the best way of addressing this Challenge it will be up to proposers in Fund 7, if voters select this as a future Challenge.\n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRYRjmMvkJM&t=1389s", "how_does_success_look_like_": "The Cardano community creates novel roadmaps for 2025, inspiring new teams to build, deliver, expand and implement projects", "importance": "Developing alternative and complementary community visions of Cardano's future will help expand scope and impact of IOG's roadmap for 2025"}, {"id": 366901, "category": 26120, "no_assessments": 0, "title": "DeFi/CeFi Cardano&...TBC in Fund 7", "url": "https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/366901-48088", "description": "How can we create an environment for seamless (no extra fee/delay) integration b/w ADA and FIAT?", "requested_funds": "400000", "challenge_brief": "Why do we need this type of environment?

In addition, proposers should answer the following questions:\n\nHow do they manage their campaigns?\n\nWhy and how are they using the proposed online channel or platform for their marketing efforts?\n\nHow do they evaluate their campaigns (metrics, KPIs)?\n\nHow does the community have access to campaign data?\n\n  \n\nThis challenge aims to give professional and experienced marketers the financial framework to use their skills to increase Catalyst's reach and awareness.
