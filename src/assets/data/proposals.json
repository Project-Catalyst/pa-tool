Here is a basic snapshot of what happens when it rains on a (1) \"conventional\" chemical-dependent annual monocrop field vs a (2) regenerative system known as \"silvopasture.\"\n\n1.  Raindrops hit bare soil (thanks to herbicides preventing the tendency of soil to cover itself in greenery). Rain erodes topsoil and conveys mud, fertilizer, and herbicides across the landscape into sensitive wetlands, streams, rivers, and eventually the ocean. The harms stack up, requiring farmers to drill deeper and deeper wells or abandon their land altogether. Nitrogen and Phosphorous, important sources of fertility, instead act as toxins in river systems and are responsible for oceanic \"deadzones\" in regions of oceans that once teemed with life thanks to the ecological transit of resources up and down rivers.\n    \n2.  Raindrops hit a landscape where every square inch of soil is covered in plant life. Rain hits a pasture that has recently been grazed over by bison, conveying water and natural fertility (urine and manure) into the highly absorbant soil matrix where nutrients are bound up in complex ecosystems of microbial and macrobial life. Topsoil deepens, pasture improves, meaning every year there are more bison. Deep perennial root systems both help to recharge groundwater and to draw groundwater up in a cycle of transpiration that adds to healthy precipitation patterns in the region and beyond. All fertility is captured, little runs off the landscape, ensuring that downstream river systems and seas have appropriately nutrient levels where fisheries can thrive.\n    \n\n\\--------\n\n**The unique attributes listed above tend to make regenerative agriculture a difficult sector for traditional financing and investment.** While few large farms make the transition to regenerative, those that have done so often see **positive economic outcomes** thanks to fewer inputs, more consistent yields, often greater yields, and higher prices.\u00a0 For instance, using rough figures, in the US, a corn farmer might expect to generate $100 proft/ acre on a field of commodity \"feed corn\" to be used in large confinement livestock operations.\u00a0 If the same acreage were transitioned (over several years) to a silvopasture system that supports e.g. cattle on the land itself, their profit/acre can reliably reach $250/acre.\u00a0 Despite the economic incentive, established farms are slow to transition thanks to factors like the average farmer being 67 years old, being heavily invested in machinery, and reliant on government subsidies that are specific about the way funds can be used.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThere is a trend: en masse farmers are selling their land to agrobusinesses who control vast acreage and sections of the food supply.\u00a0 But at the same time, a growing number of farms ARE transitioning, or are selling their land to young farmers who are more keen to adopt regenerative methods.\n\n\u00a0Financial considerations aside, **the regenerative space as an integrated network is still in its very early days, with plenty of work to be done in areas like research and education which can also be facilitated by a decentralized funding source like Catalyst.**\n\nThere is also a more intangible way that reckoning with a challenge as complex as advancing regenerative agriculture will improve the Cardano/Catalyst communities.\u00a0 In crypto and in regenerative we talk about \"ecosystems\" but these ecosystems are, on their face, radically different.\u00a0 \u00a0I think that it will be a challenge for tech-minded folks who make up much of Cardano and Catalyst to open up to the idea that working with complex natural systems is a form of advanced technology because it looks much \"messier\" and \"wild\" than robots growing vegetables indoors with sensors and drones.\u00a0 \u00a0Tech-minded folks can tend to see that the outsourcing of human work to technology is by definition progress.\u00a0 But in reality, we are living beings who have evolved to live in and love nature.\u00a0 \u00a0And our health, the health of the family shopping at a farmers market, and the health of the Ethiopian cowherd, are often best served when human hands work the soil, with the help of healthy ecosystems.\n\nBy focusing a Catalyst challenge question on regenerative agriculture, we have an opportunity to advance key metrics like onboarding new wallet addresses, DIDs, oracles, and future catalyst proposers, while helping to facilitate information sharing, networking, market development in a rapidly growing sector.\u00a0 We also have a chance to show the world that **the technology that will facilitate a more resilient food system is not necessarily agrotech, sensors and robots, but a financial operating system with a governance stack that can mobilize people to get to work in the soil.**\n\n\\*Note.\u00a0 If you are working on a proposal in the agriculture space and aren't necessarily sure that it fits within \"regenerative,\" consider submitting it here.\u00a0 **Being 100% regenerative is not the goal.\u00a0 The goal is to transition land to systems that are increasingly regenerative.**\u00a0 While it is up to the community to define the boundaries here, I would suggest that a farmer mustn't totally abandon chemical fertilizer to submit a proposal for funding.\u00a0 And there may even be a place for imports and exports.\u00a0 And while we believe that more human hands in the soil is a good thing for humans and the planet, there is certainly a place for robots and sensors deployed in intelligent ways.\u00a0 In short, **we are about Change, not Dogma.**\n\nYOU are invited!\n\nA quick plug:\u00a0 Regenseed.io is a webite (under construction!!) where I, a Cardano fanboy, mushroom farmer, and believer in regenerative farming have been recording thoughts on the above topics and more.

The challenge for fund 7 should be to take Catalyst to the streets by financing, at a 75% level (open to changes), various community proposed projects with a common goal. The original idea was that these outlets/businesses would have one thing in common: any sales made in ADA would come at a 10/15/20% discount. For example, a coffee or restaurant which sells a cofee at 1$ would sell it at 0.85$ (15% discount) if paid in ADA.\u00a0 However, proposers could come up with other creative ways to incentivise and facilitate adoption of ADA through their projects.\n\nThe idea of this new challenge is to fund at a 75% aid intensity proposed projects which incentivise adoption of Cardano. This chalenge wouldd involve inactive people already present within Catalyst since it opens up Catalyst for anybody who wants to start hiw/her own business. The reason for not fully funding the project is that one would want some accountability by the proposer.\u00a0\n\n  \n\nRefund Process:\n\n2/5% of all sales generated (depending on the operating margin of the business) is to be sent back to the treasury (or a separate treasury spexifically for the challenge). On a base case, I would expect that investment is fully returned after 5 years time. However, evaluation of projects is crucial and must be strictly conducted.\u00a0\n\n  \n\nSpreading adoption / Avoiding Concentration of projects:\n\nI would suggest that such fund be divided in countries where only 1 project per country can be awarded per fund. There can be a bonus project with double the fund allocation to allow for market penetration in acclaimed areas where rent costs (amongst others) would be much higher. This project is giving incentives to people to join the Cardano ecosystem by providing them with financial motivation to have their project funded. Secondly, once a finded project is up and running, customers of this project's business would have a reason why they should hold at least in a small portion, some ADA currency. The reason being to have a discount for their purchases.\n\nThe business must clearly advertise the 'discount' and in case where there are sales persons or cashier's they must clearly tell each customer that there is a discount for those paying with ADA.\n\nAlso, there must be a sign where it says \"Funded by Project Catalyst (Cardano)\".\u00a0\n\n  \n\nE-commerce portals:\n\nThis is also very easily done on websites with an online payment option, where a discount is shown to apply if you chose the 'pay with ADA' option.\u00a0\n\n  \n\n**++Evaluating a proposal++**\n\nA business plan with clear revenue and profit forecasts must be put forward. Rationale of how one arrived to the figures must be clear and expenses must be substantiated by evidence where possible. Community advisors should have a background in finance or be successful entrepreneurs themselves.\u00a0\n\n***Diversification from competitors:***\n\nThe idea is to incentivise people to set-up a wallet and purchase ADA. Projects which are diverse from the competition should be prefered. So we are talking about product differentiation, price competition, innvovative products.\u00a0\n\n***Branding and Copyright:***\n\nThis has not been tackled yet and ideally a brand would be set up by IOHK with free licensing to the selected projects or even external investors upon review of their project. This licence could also be used to set an agreement for the 2/5% revenue \u00b4fee\u00b4 (which then the treasury should hold the licensing rights). It would be very powerful for Cardano to build an empire of \"Caf\u00e8 ADA\" around the globe. How could it be ignored? Or even have the ADA newspaper with its newsroom. As long as the projects are profitable, the treasury will grow exponentially and in 10 years any project would be practically possible.\u00a0\n\n  \n\n**++Auditability++**\n\nHow do you know that the proposer is respecting the terms of the grant?\n\nFirst of all, when issuing the grant, it has to be done upon presentation of invoices, proof of payment and evidence of work done. Community advisors can do this, or a separate committee appointed.\n\nSecondly, the way payments in ADA are to be effected would be though a QR code displayed on the cashier counter. The code would hold the business wallet address. This should be a function which will become present in wallets.\n\nNow, how does one ensure that these guidelines are being followed ? One should first rely on the community to flag irregularities.\u00a0 As the community is quite large and continues to grow, it should be enoigh to regulate or check these businesses (simply by visitng these places). Secondly, especially at the start of the challenge, a set of mystery shoppers can be tasked to visit certain place at a certain frequency to ensure that the project is reaching its goals. One would simply have people shop at these businesses and report back. Mystery shopper should be paid say 50$ in ADA for each visit.\u00a0\n\n  \n\n**How does the business make a profit if it has lower margins than the discount offered?**\n\nThe discount given to ADA payers would be essentially written off against the rest of the sales. Furthermore, most businesses like supermarkets, coffee shops and bars have higher profit margins than 20%. Besides the margin, one has to consider the fixed costs including rent, wages, water and electricity and more. However, once the business scales there will be enough sales to cater for these expenses. Problems could arise if the ADA sales represent a sizable portion of total sales. This is highly unlikely especially at the early stages, nonetheless, in this case the discounts can be scaled down proportionally with the increase in ADA paid sales.\n\n  \n\n**++Problems solved++**\n\n***1)Community engagement:***\n\nThis has often been limited to developers as many people lack knowledge and skills to even put forward a proposal. This challenge opens the gates to literally anybody who is willing to open a business.\n\n***2)Cardano Exposure:***\n\nMany proposals talk about marketing and advertisements. Well, what better advertisement that to have a coffe shop named \"Caf\u00e8 ADA\" or \"Cafe Cardano\" in the middle of a busy street which offer large discount for crypto payments. And through the community already existing in Cardano, we can have at least 10 places in various countries open at each Fund round, increasing at an exponential rate through revenue generation of the fund itself.\n\n***3)Incentivise and Retain Community advisors and voters:***\n\nOutlets themselves can offer increased discounts to Community Advisors and Voters (a wallet register would be set-up - identity can still be kept anonymous) thereby incentivising participation of both advisors and voters. This can be linked with an eventual honour/tier system which has been proposed for the advisors and voters based on their output.\n\n***4)Attracting new Entrepreneurs to the Ecosystem:***\n\nThese sort of grants would definitely attract the ear of various entrepreneurs who either do not have the funding or else do not want to take on the risk of opening their business. Naturally, the set-off would be that any project must incentivise the use or adoption of Cardano.\n\n**5)Expand the network through actual use cases and incentives**\n\nIncetivise the general public to become part of Cardano by offering them a reason to do it - purchase at a discounted rate. Aligning interests of the public of cost savings with those of Cardano.\n\n***6) Sustainability; A Self-financing Challenge:***\n\nIf all goes well, this challenge will be self sustaining and could also feed the treasury as a profit will eventually be made by the business and the treasury (be it the existing one or a separate one) will continue to benefit.\n\n  \n\n**++Funding++**\n\nAssuming a 100,000 grant which would mean an investment of 100,000/0.75=133,333 , a 1,000,000 allocation could finance 10 businesses every funding round or 9 businesses if the double financing project is added. This is a good starting point.\n\n  \n\n**++Future Prospects++**\n\nSetting up a similar system but using private pools to set-up a business whilst utilising the existing set-up and having the pool pay for the community advisors, evaluation committee etc. At the same time, pools shall be self-insured through reserving a portion of profits obtained from successful business where pool delegators are assured that they will not lose their initial investment. Naturally, a pool would not invest in 1 project but in a number of projects given a particular sector make-up. The issue shall only be how to procure the initial insurance funds which shall be equivalent to at least 90% of the invested projects. This could be however a separate challenge funded by Catalyst. Essentially the amount put forward by Catalyst would be a fail safe and hopefully not needed. Amount to be reimbursed to Catalyst one pool is doing well and self-insured by own funds. This is also very much scalable to Africa and will also try to submit a proposal there.\n\n  \n\n**Thank you for taking the time to read.

A \"Build it and they will come\" mindset is not the best path growth and adoption. The Cardano community is large, growing and filled with unknown and untapped resources. This challenge seeks to call out those who have ideas, are resourceful, energetic and perhaps know someone or know someone who knows someone who is a decision-maker or an influencer for decision-makers in small or undeveloped countries. Able to formulate and articulate practical use-cases that solve recognised needs based on Cardano. Reach, present to and persuade decision-makers and begin the implementation process as a second phase (different Challenge).\n\nCritical mass and first mover advantages can come both in the number of individuals adopting the Cardano and the number of use-case implementations, irrespective of the numbers of adoptions. Small and underdeveloped countries or even sub-units (social groups) recognise their problems and needs. They lack solutions. Tailor-made applications / use-cases, based on sensible implementations of the Cardano protocol can answer some of those needs. This challenge attempts to fund their efforts to identify needs, scope out tailor made use-cases and begin the proposal implementation process.\n\n\"Competitiveness\"\n\nOther blockchains have a head start in this space. A small team has implemented a national currency built on Algorand for the Republic of the Marshall Islands. (See sovfoundation.com) A small island nation, the Marshall Islands has already adopted an Algorand based National Currency. Promoted by a three man team (https://sfb-tech.com/) without any special experience in blockchain.

More people have access to better healthcare, decent work, and education than ever before. But inequalities and climate change are threatening to undo the gains.\n\nWith the world increasingly facing the extremely damaging impacts of climate change upon ecosystems, populations and species, the need to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C cannot be contested. Alarming data includes the loss of primary rainforest equivalent to a football pitch every 6 seconds in 2019 leading to dramatic consequences such as soil erosion, flooding, loss of biodiversity, carbon release or fishery livelihoods being threatened in small island developing countries, or the Coral Triangle region in South-East Asia due to warming water temperatures and coral bleaching.\n\n**At the core of the 2020-2030 decade of action is the need for action** to tackle growing poverty, empower women and girls, and address the climate emergency. Sustainable development has been defined as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\n\nSustainable development calls for concerted efforts towards building an inclusive, sustainable and resilient future for people and planet.\n\nFor sustainable development to be achieved, it is crucial to **harmonize** three core elements: economic growth, social inclusion and environmental protection. These elements are **interconnected**, and all are crucial for the well-being of individuals and societies.\n\nAction against climate change entails structural behavioural change at an individual and systemic level to embed sustainable practices.\n\nThis will entail the transition and adoption of frameworks of thinking that ensure sustainability is embedded at all levels of action. From our planetary boundaries to our core social foundations, including all strata of society.\n\n\u2022 Eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions is an indispensable requirement for sustainable development. To this end, there must be promotion of sustainable, inclusive and equitable economic growth, creating greater opportunities for all, reducing inequalities, raising basic standards of living, fostering equitable social development and inclusion, and promoting integrated and sustainable management of natural resources and ecosystems.\n\n\u2022 Investment in inclusive and sustainable economies can unleash significant opportunities for shared prosperity. And the political, technological and financial solutions are within reach. But much greater leadership and rapid, unprecedented changes are needed to align these levers of change with sustainable development objectives. #ForPeopleForPlanet\n\n\u2022 To achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals, annual investment requirements across all sectors have been estimated at around $5-7 trillion. Current investment levels are far from the scale needed. With global financial assets estimated at over $200 trillion, financing is available, but most of these resources are not being channelled towards sustainable development at the scale and speed necessary to achieve the SDGs and objectives of the Paris Agreement on climate change.\n\n\u2022 Interest and investment in the Sustainable Development Goals are growing and investment in the Goals makes economic sense. Achieving the SDGs could open up US$12 trillion of market opportunities and create 380 million new jobs by 2030.\n\n**Cardano Sustainability**\n\n**Encouraging the growth of a Community Led Local Hubs Network as a means of accelerating and expanding the Cardano ecosystem in strategic places for high SDG impact:**\n\nOut of the world's approximately 7.8 billion inhabitants, 6.45 billion do not speak English as their first language. Living in the Western world, one may forget this fact, with many never having considered it.\n\nLet's consider it now.\n\nLet's build an ecosystem that grows sustainably, in harmony from the local to global scale, while remaining inclusive and equitable.\n\nWhen you drive grassroots adoption, you do more than just 'build cool products'; you empower people to change their lives and world in previously unimaginable ways. You give them the tools to imagine that anything is possible.\n\nRemember that the **Bitcoin network is one protocol of the 75% of blockchains that use Proof of Work (PoW) mining power** to reach consensus.\n\nWith consensus on the **Cardano blockchain through Ouroboros estimated to be over four-million times more energy-efficient than the Bitcoin protocol** - let's use the tools available to us today to help build a sustainable world.\n\nIn a world where Cardano exists, maybe we don't have to wish for these things to happen, we make them happen!\n\n**EACH PROPOSAL PUT FORWARD FOR THIS CHALLENGE CAN REQUEST FUNDS AMOUNTING TO NO MORE THAN A MAXIMUM OF 20% OF THE TOTAL FUND AVAILABLE.**\n\n**THIS IS TO PROMOTE AND ENCOURAGE A DIVERSITY OF PROPOSALS :)**\n\n**++Guiding Budget Rationale:++**\n\n*   Basic infrastructure costs\n*   Developer Training, Education and Tools\n*   Catalyst Proposer Onboarding\n*   Translation and Outreach\n*   And more\u2026\n\n  \n\n**++For more information:++**\n\n\\* https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/development-agenda/\n\n\\* https://en.unesco.org/news/unesco-launch-esd-2030-roadmap-africa-region\n\n\\* https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000374802\n\n\\* https://forum.cardano.org/t/world-computers-that-don-t-cost-the-earth/41259\n\n\\* https://forum.cardano.org/t/consensus-on-cardano-vs-other-blockchains/38738\n\n  \n\n**++Videos on sustainability:++**\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkg2XMTWV4g\n\n\\- 1.

The group was contracted to design, build, and maintain Cardano through to 2020.\n\nIOG CEO Charles Hoskinson\u00a0recently outlined a major, ambitious vision for shaping up a long-term roadmap pushing Cardano towards 2025.\n\nSome elements of the vision include first completing Ouroboros Omega (which will be available by end of 2021), as a capstone of research. Elements that will be explored are fast finality, sidechains, no reliance on external clocks, the ability to gracefully recover from 51% attacks, plus a little faster TPS.\n\nThe 2025 agenda will includes reaching Ouroboros Omega++.\n\nAnother part of the roadmap is Light Clients (such as Yoroi) which are easy to do with trust assumptions (someone running a server that is a window into the system). There are other protocols on the market such as MINA that uses recursive SNARKs that proof that the coins exist and have not been spent - even without having a copy of the blockchain.\n\nIOG's paper on the Mithral Protocol is expected to come out by end of 2021 and possibly a prototype, with the idea of creating a similar trust model that would allow a light client by default.\u00a0\n\nFor a sidechains model and layer 2 infrastructure, IOG is exploring adding sidechains support for EVM, IELE, Catalyst, etc. via a community approved hard-fork combinator event following a Cardano Improvement Proposal.\u00a0\n\nPrism and DID embedding is also in the pipeline for authenticated wallets and regulated DeFi spaces, permissioned for access with certain credentials and leading to Human Readable Addresses.\u00a0\n\nAnother piece of off-chain infrastructure is Hydra, based on a four paper agenda (two finished, two to be finished by end of 2021). Hydra is a craft-on layer two solution that SPOs will be able to add on. With you have a Cardano DApp you will be able to use Prism for free, as well as using Hydra.\u00a0\n\nOther elements mentioned in scope for 2025 include: quantum resistance, zero-knowledge crypto, quantum resistance with the signature scheme, how to use quantum computers to enhance Cardano, modelling quantum adversaries - a big Quantum agenda.\u00a0\n\nOn the governance side, a lot of work will be done to link Catalyst (concerned with Treasury) with Voltaire (concerned with Protocol updates). The unification will start in 2021, extending and finishing in 2022. The governance system will probably be a bicameral voting model with feedback, expert ballots, correct economics.\n\nIn a April 5 2021 video, Hoskinson stated that IOG's aim is to overbuild the governance stuff in Catalyst and Voltaire by adding other voting systems, such as preference voting, quadratic voting, all of which will be available for use in DApps.\u00a0\n\nIOG will also launch a research agenda to move from a plutocratic model (right now) to a hybrid model (ADA + Proof of Merit). This segment is closer to the 2025 part of the 2021-25 research agenda. The idea is to use different resources inside the system, as people build identity and reputation inside the system.\u00a0\n\n  \n\nCHALLENGE BRIEF:\n\nAs Cardano is a decentralized project and community, the IOG-proposed roadmap is clearly a major contribution for the ecosystem - but it does not eliminate the possibility of alternative and complementary visions. The roadmap that is expected later this year - will also serve as a foundational platform for many more complementary projects, visions, teams and strategies that can start building upon its vision.\u00a0\n\nThe brief for this Challenge is to propose new mechanisms, platforms, teams and tools for development (or the expansion of existing\u00a0mechanisms, platforms, teams and tools) to start working on creating community-based ideas for the Cardano 2025 roadmap.\u00a0\n\nThe future development of Cardano is being planned and decided soon and the community needs to step up and participate.\u00a0\n\n  \n\n**SUGGESTIONS WELCOME**\n\n  \n\n  \n\n\u00a0Important note: This is a Fund6 Challenge Setting proposal - for a future challenge in Fund 7.
